// substituteAll is a lightweight "substitution tags" engine that implement a global substitute for multiple items.
//
// The key values in your locals object are replaced. Unlike other templating systems it doesn't specify characters that surround your tokens.
//
// The function does not encode HTML entities. Don't use this to generate HTML. There are plently of alternative like underscore.js that do that already.
//
// It is equivalent to:
// ```js
// locals = { '-first-': 'Joe', '-last-': 'Smith' }
// substitute( substitute("-first- -last", '-first-',  locals), '-last-', 'Smith', locals)
// ```
